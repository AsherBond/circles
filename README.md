Circles allows your users to create their own groups of users/colleagues/friends. 
Those groups of users (or circles) can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose 
(files, social feed, status update, messaging, ...) through the Circles API

Different types of circles can be created:


- A **Personal Circle** is a list of users known only to yourself. 
Use this if you want to send messages or share things repeatedly to the same group of people. 
Only you will know the members list of a personal circle.
- A **Public Circle** is an open group visible to anyone in the cloud, and everyone will be able to join it. 
- A **Closed Circle** require an invitation or a confirmation from an admin, This way you can create a team or a group of people.
This is the best circle if you are looking for privacy when sharing your files or else.
- An **Secret Circle** is an open group that can be protected by a password. 
Select this circle to create a public community that will not be displayed to everyone like the Public Circle.
