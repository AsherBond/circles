# Nextcloud Circles


### Bring cloud-users closer together

Circles allow people to create their own groups of people/colleagues/friends. 
Those groups of people (or circles) can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose 
 through the Circles API


# Installation
The *Circles* app is installed and enabled by default since Nextcloud 22.

# Documentation
You can use the `\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface`, see [dependency injection](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/developer_manual/basics/dependency_injection.html), to get the `\OCA\Circles\CireclesManager` class, see our [API documentation](https://nextcloud.github.io/circles/) for its interface.
