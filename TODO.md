- Verify that a user can be added to this circle (based on the Config of the circle)
- 



### Must be done when the project is more advanced:
Cannot be done until I get a better overview of the project

- [ ] #M004: confirm Member (hasMember() and member have an instance set) when managing RemoteEvent
- [ ] #E001: confirm and manage event when initiated from another instance.
- [ ] #C001: allow an 'All' request to the database only available to the backend to also includes some specific circles (single, fully hidden, ...)



### Lazy while coding:
I got lazy and afraid to get lost the first throw of code

- [ ] #M003: confirm other type of User when adding a new member to a circle.
- [ ] confirm MemberId and CircleId is really not known before creating entry in database.
- Add better option to circles:manage:list



### Ideas
Some sparks that can happens anytime of the day or night.



### Questions
Should I do it ?


### renaming
Some Model/Method needs renaming for better readability

- [ ] rename getViewer/setViewer to getInitiator/setInitiator
- [ ] rename IMember to ICircleUser
- [ ] rename Member to CircleMember
- [ ] rename CurrentUser to CloudUser
- [ ] rename IRemoteEvent to IRemoteItem or IRemoteCommand or IRemoteObject
- [ ] rename RemoteEvent (needed ?)





### Over the top

- [ ] #M002: When adding a member from a remote instance, request the remote instance to check user availability. Might be better to add an option to allow that check.
